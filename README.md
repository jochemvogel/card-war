Card War is a very basic, but fun game. It looks like a gamble game. You play against the computer and every round new random cards will appear. The one who with the highest card wins the round. The first one who've reached the 10 points wins the game.

I've followed some tutorials on the YouTube channel of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CsFQZBKGT8" target="_blank"> CodeWithChris </a>. He made this app as example, but it didn't work that good. I've added some extra features and I'll probably add some more in the future.
